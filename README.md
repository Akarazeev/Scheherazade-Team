The subjects of my interests: mathematical logic, probability theory, mathematical statistics, linear algebra, computer science (machine learning, NLP), bioinformatics and physics (molecular dynamics). I use in my projects programming languages such as C/C++(multithreading and concurrency) and Python(including numpy, pandas, sklearn; experienced with TensorFlow). Alexa Prize is a great opportunity to use and improve my NLP-skills. Also I'm trainee in the lab for "Functional Analysis of Genes". I use here my Python-skills and knowledge of NLP. Most of my projects are located in GitHub: github.com/Akarazeev.

![photo]() Denis Antyukhov | I am a graduate student working on my second MSc on NLP. I received education from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. I also spent a semester at MIT as a visiting student, where I studied Machine Learning and NLP. My current focus is applying Deep Learning methods to NLP, particularly Convolutional Networks, Memory Networks and Recurrent Networks. After obtaining my second MSc, I plan to pursue a PhD degree.
