The subjects of my interests: mathematical logic, mathematical statistics, computer science, bioinformatics and physics. I use in my projects programming languages such as C/C++(multithreading and concurrency) and Python(including numpy, pandas, sklearn; experienced with TensorFlow). Alexa Prize is a great opportunity to use and improve my NLP-skills. Also I'm trainee in the lab for "Functional Analysis of Genes". I use here my Python-skills and knowledge of NLP. github.com/Akarazeev
