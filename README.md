My areas of interest are corpus linguistics, machine learning, deep learning and NLP.
Anton Karazeev ![photo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11920213/19814332/78ec7d92-9d46-11e6-9dcb-9487891d3a25.jpg) &lt;anton.karazeev at phystech.edu&gt; | I'm third year student at MIPT. The subjects of my interests: mathematical logic, mathematical statistics, computer science, bioinformatics and physics. I use in my projects programming languages such as C/C++(multithreading and concurrency) and Python(including numpy, pandas, sklearn; experienced with TensorFlow). Alexa Prize is a great opportunity to use and improve my NLP-skills. Also I'm trainee in the lab for "Functional Analysis of Genes". I use here my Python-skills and knowledge of NLP. github.com/Akarazeev
